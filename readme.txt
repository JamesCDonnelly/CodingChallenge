I had a lot of fun putting this together. 
I wanted to create something that would produce responses based on input as I find the generated responses can be very interesting.
I was inspired in part by the bodyhorror game genre and auto generated writing of Dawrf Fortress. 
I knew I wanted to create creatures and this was originally going to be a somewhat parody of Pokemon only with a morbid description for each creature. This evolved into the facility idea that allowed some element of customization in the description you would receive.
